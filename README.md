# Numerosity Perception ERP Effects and Spectral Power Dynamics
This project investigates early visual ERP effects and spectral power dynamics in numerosity perception using EEG data analysis in MATLAB.

## Background
Numerosity perception refers to the ability to rapidly approximate the number of items in a visual scene without counting. This study examines ERPs and spectral power signals in response to experimental conditions related to numerosity, size, and spacing of visual stimuli.

Understanding the neural correlates of numerosity perception can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying numerical cognition.

## Methods
* EEG data was collected from 14 participants at the CoDeNeuro Lab while they performed a numerosity discrimination task.
* Preprocessing and analysis was conducted in MATLAB using EEGLAB and custom scripts.
* ERP analysis involved averaging epochs, filtering, and creating grand averages across participants.
* Time-frequency analysis was performed to examine power in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands under different conditions.
## Scripts
The main scripts are:

* erpanalysis.m - Performs ERP analysis on preprocessed EEG data
* tfanalysis.m - Analyzes time-frequency power for different conditions
Note: The original data files are not included here due to size constraints and privacy considerations.

## Results
Key findings include:

* ERP effects were observed in early visual components like P1 and N1.
* Distinct patterns of spectral power were noted across conditions and frequency bands.
* The gamma power results were variable and no clear trend was observed across conditions.
## Conclusion
The analysis revealed early ERP effects and dynamics of spectral power during numerosity perception. This contributes to our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in numerical cognition.
